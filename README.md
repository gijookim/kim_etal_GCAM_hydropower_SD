# kim_etal_GCAM_hydropower_SD

This repository contains the code used to generate the data and figures in the paper "Mapping the future role of hydropower under global low-carbon transitions through large ensemble scenario discovery" by Kim et al., which is currently in revision.

# Reproducing the results
This study consists of two steps:
 1. Compiling, building, and running Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), which represents the interactions between socioeconomic-climate-land-energy-water systems. In order to replicate aour experiment, the user should use GCAM with endogenous representation of hydropower with climate change impact feature implemented. The model is available 10.5281/zenodo.13863869.
 2. Analysis

To run GCAM,
