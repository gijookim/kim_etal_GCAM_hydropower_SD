# kim_etal_GCAM_hydropower_SD

This repository contains the code used to generate the data and figures in the paper "Mapping the future role of hydropower under global low-carbon transitions through large ensemble scenario discovery" by Kim et al., which is currently in revision.

# Reproducing the results
This study consists of two steps:
 1. **Compiling, building, and running Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM)**, which represents the interactions between socioeconomic-climate-land-energy-water systems. In order to replicate aour experiment, the user should use GCAM with endogenous representation of hydropower with climate change impact feature implemented. 
 2. **Querying relevant GCAM outputs** that are further used for analysis. We
 3. **Reproducing the figures** in the paper using the script in this repository.

To install and run GCAM scenarios, follow the instructions on https://github.com/JGCRI/gcam-core/releases/tag/gcam-v5.3. Be sure to download and compile the model at 10.5281/zenodo.13863869.
